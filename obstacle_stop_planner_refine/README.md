# obstacle_stop_planner

## Purpose

`obstacle_stop_planner` is a node to modify trajectory's velocity based on obstacles(represented as pointcloud and bounding boxes).

![component_diagram](./img/component_diagram.svg)

`obstacle_stop_planner` has 3 features.

1. stop_planner
    - Stop if obstacle is in the detection area
2. slow_down_planner
    - Slow down if obstacle is in the detection area(larger than stop_planner's one)
3. adaptive_cruise_planner
    - Adjust velocity based on front obstacles

### How to search collisions

1. Generate a detection area considering the ego-vehicleâ€™s shape
2. Search obstacle pointcloud in the detection area
    - To reduce calculation cost, use 2 step search(roughly circular search and precise polygon search)

### How to set stop(or slow_down) velocity

1. Calculate vehicle's head pose considering a safe margin(`*_margin` parameter)
2. Calculate `base_link` pose from the head pose
    - Since Autoware's trajectory is based on `base_link` position, Planners should set velocity of `base_link` at each point
3. Insert a new pose that has stop(or slow_down) velocity to trajectory
4. Modify velocity in trajectory based on the inserted pose
    - When stopping, set zero velocity until trajectory end in order to stop for sure
    - When slowing down, set slow down velocity to a period

### How to follow front obstacles adaptively

1. Infer a velocity of front obstacles

    - When using dynamic objects
        - Just take the velocity in the object
    - When using pointcloud
        - Calculate velocity from delta-movement of the nearest point

2. Plan velocity based on the relationship between ego-vehicle and front obstacles

    - Suppose both ego-vehicle and obstacles follow constant acceleration model
    - Suppose obstacles will slightly slow down in order to be conservative and to avoid crash
        - Since it's difficult to estimate acceleration precisely, giving it as a parameter
    - Calculate a suitable distance to obstacle considering `free running distance`, `braking distance`, etc.
    - When the distance to obstacle becomes lower than a limit, the vehicle pauses adaptive cruising and will try to stop before crash

## Assumptions/Known limits

The tracking algorithm in `adaptive_cruise_planner` is very simple, so basically it's not recommended.
When you use it, please take care of the vehicle's behavior as much as possible and always be ready for overriding.

## Future extensions/Unimplemented parts

Currently, all obstacle's pointcloud is input to `obstacle_stop_planner`, but it forces `obstacle_stop_planner` to estimate velocity of pointcloud that includes moving vehicles.
If it doesn't estimate velocity of pointcloud, it recognizes all obstacles as stopped and the cruising speed goes quite low so the ego-vehicle can't drive on public roads smoothly.
Therefore, it's preferable we have an advanced tracker in the former stages and pass only limited objects(static obstacles + untracked objects) to `obstacle_stop_planner`.
